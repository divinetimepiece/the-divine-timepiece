# Calendars

This folder contains the full visual reconstruction of the 364-day algorithmic calendar described in *The Divine Timepiece*.

## Contents

- `calendar-q1.pdf` — Quarter 1: Nisan to Sivan  
- `calendar-q2.pdf` — Quarter 2: Tammuz to Elul  
- `calendar-q3.pdf` — Quarter 3: Tishri to Kislev  
- `calendar-q4.pdf` — Quarter 4: Tevet to Adar  
- `calendar-full.pdf` — All four quarters combined into a single scroll-style layout

Each PDF is designed for visual verification, highlighting weekly Sabbaths and fixed feast dates. These representations align with the five foundational rules detailed in the paper and serve as executable outputs of the reconstructed calendar system.

*Note: HTML versions may be added later pending final review.*
