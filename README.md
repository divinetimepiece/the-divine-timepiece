Reconstructing the Temple Scroll's generative calendar system — the Divine Timepiece hidden in plain sight for 2,000 years.

# The Divine Timepiece

**A reconstruction of the 364-day algorithmic calendar encoded in the Temple Scroll (11Q19), revealing its profound alignment with New Testament chronology.**

This repository contains the full preprint of *The Divine Timepiece*, alongside supporting calendar visualisations and associated assets. The study proposes that the calendar described in the Dead Sea Scrolls is not a static rule-based alternative to the Jewish lunisolar system, but a concise algorithmic structure—generating perpetual sacred time through logic, not intercalation.

## Overview

The Temple Scroll calendar divides the year into 12 months of fixed 30-30-31 day patterns, always beginning on a Wednesday and maintaining a perfect 7-day cycle. When its rules are applied to Gospel chronology, extraordinary alignments emerge:

- A Tuesday crucifixion on 14 Nisan, 32 CE  
- A visible blood moon confirming the timeline  
- A re-positioned Pentecost on Sivan 15  
- A 50-day harvest cycle reflected in resurrection appearances  

The study argues that these consistencies point to an intentional use of the 364-day calendar by Gospel authors, suggesting the survival of a sacred operating system encoded in Scripture itself.
