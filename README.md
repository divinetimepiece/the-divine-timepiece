Reconstructing the Temple Scroll's generative calendar system ‚Äî the Divine Timepiece hidden in plain sight for 2,000 years.

# The Divine Timepiece

**A reconstruction of the 364-day algorithmic calendar encoded in the Temple Scroll (11Q19), revealing its profound alignment with New Testament chronology.**

This repository contains the full preprint of *The Divine Timepiece*, alongside supporting calendar visualisations and associated assets. The study proposes that the calendar described in the Dead Sea Scrolls is not a static rule-based alternative to the Jewish lunisolar system, but a concise algorithmic structure‚Äîgenerating perpetual sacred time through logic, not intercalation.

## Overview

The Temple Scroll calendar divides the year into 12 months of fixed 30-30-31 day patterns, always beginning on a Wednesday and maintaining a perfect 7-day cycle. When its rules are applied to Gospel chronology, extraordinary alignments emerge:

- A Tuesday crucifixion on 14 Nisan, 32 CE  
- A visible blood moon confirming the timeline  
- A re-positioned Pentecost on Sivan 15  
- A 50-day harvest cycle reflected in resurrection appearances  

The study argues that these consistencies point to an intentional use of the 364-day calendar by Gospel authors, suggesting the survival of a sacred operating system encoded in Scripture itself.

## üìú Epilogue: *The Last Loose End*

A companion reflection to the main preprint, exploring a final narrative puzzle:

> If the crucifixion was on a Tuesday, why didn‚Äôt the women return to the tomb sooner?

This standalone essay examines the apparent contradiction between **John 19:40** and **Luke 24:1**, and how the reconstructed Temple Scroll calendar not only resolves the timeline ‚Äî but restores human dignity to the women‚Äôs role in the burial. It introduces the ‚Äútwo-stage burial‚Äù model: **triage by Nicodemus**, followed by **ceremonial completion by the women**. A final narrative thread, now whole.
